# German Credit Risk Clasifier using R

# Project : Risk Classification using Machine Learning.

# 1. Dataset
The data set that was used in this project comprises 1000 instances represent credit transactions.
Each sample is represented a transaction. Among which 13 attributes are categorical and 7 are numerical.

# 2. Preprocessing

## 3. Label Encoding
In order to convert the categorical values to numerical values over all samples, we used Label Encoding technique.



## 4. Normalization
In order to normalize the range of the feature values over all samples, we standardized(aka normlize) the
continuous feature values according to the formula:
                                        ```x(max−min)+min```


x represents the column vector containing continuous feature values of each of the
continuous-valued attributes for all samples.


# 5. Training and Test
[Task] -> Binary Classification

[Training set] -> 800 rows, 21 columns

[Test set] -> 200 rows, 21 columns

[Predictors] -> V1,V2,V3.....V20

[Response] -> V21


# 6. Model Selection

1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machines
3. Adaboost(Best Model) --> Good Accuracy, Less False Negatives
4. Random Forest

# 7. Modelling and Results

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

# 8. Program Execution
Run shinyApp() function in the code to input sample values.

```shinyApp(ui, server)```
