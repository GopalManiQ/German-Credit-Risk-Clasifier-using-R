# German Credit Risk Clasifier using R

# Project : Risk Classification using Machine Learning.

# Dataset
The data set that was used in this project comprises 1000 instances represent credit transactions.
Each sample is represented a transaction. Among which 13 attributes are categorical and 7 are numerical.

# Preprocessing

## Label Encoding
In order to convert the categorical values to numerical values over all samples, we used Label Encoding technique.



## Normalization
In order to normalize the range of the feature values over all samples, we standardized(aka normlize) the
continuous feature values according to the formula:
                                        ```x(maxâˆ’min)+min```


x represents the column vector containing continuous feature values of each of the
continuous-valued attributes for all samples.
